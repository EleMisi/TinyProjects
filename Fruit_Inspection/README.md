# Fruit Inspection Project

We analyze some fruit images to detect potential imperfections.

We perform **image segmentation** using the *Otsu's method* and we apply the **Canny Edge Detector** to locate the imperfections.  
We refine our result applying the **erosion operation** and we finally draw the detected defects.
