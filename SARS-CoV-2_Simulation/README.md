# SARS-CoV-2 spread in a company
This project was realized as part of the *Complex Systems and Network Science* exam of the [Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence,  University of Bologna](https://www.unibo.it/en/teaching/course-unit-catalogue/course-unit/2020/461740).

The aim of the project is to simulate SARS-CoV-2 spread in a fictional and simplified
company named *CSNS_Group*, and test different countermeasures. 

The company has a team-based organizational structure which network of contacts is build using a power-law
distribution. To simulate the **epidemic evolution** and **test different scenarios** we define an **epidemic model** with 6 classes and 5 control parameters.

See the [project review](https://eleonoramisino.altervista.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/SARS_CoV_2_Report.pdf) for more details.

## Run the Simulation

### Local Version
1. Download the *CSNS_Group.nlogo* file.
2. Open it with NetLogo application.
3. Follow the instruction reported in the model *Info*.


## Simulation Overview
The reception is displayed on the left, while on the right you can find:
* the chart A showing the total number of patients and the number of waiting patients;
* the chart B showing the average time spent in queue;
* the value of  *Rho*, which is strictly related to the **equilibrium condition** of our system.
