A simple example of queueing theory applied on an ideal hospital reception using an agent-based simulation implemented with NetLogo 6.0.4 (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/index.shtml)

Further information on this project can be found on my web site https://eleonoramisino.altervista.org/hospital-reception/, where you can also run the model.
